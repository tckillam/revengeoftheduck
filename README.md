To shoot, press 'F' or 'f'.
To aim/move the gun, click down on the mouse (either left or right button) and swivel it.

I did not do requirement 2.
For requirement 4, I did do option 2 for more points where the gun moves as if you are holding it, I just made the movement subtle.

Sorry for the late submission, the professor said I could hand it in as late as December 14th since I have extensions with my accommodations.
